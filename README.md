# Cryptography and Quantum Attack Simulations

## Overview
This project explores the implementation and comparison of two cryptographic systems:
- **Lattice-based Encryption** (Crypto1)
- **ECC-based Encryption** (Crypto2)

It also simulates **quantum attacks** on both systems using placeholder circuits, and performs a comparative analysis of encryption time, decryption time, cipher sizes, entropy, and bit-flip resilience.

## Project Structure
- **Crypto1.py** ‚Üí Lattice-based encryption using Learning With Errors (LWE) principles.
- **Crypto2.py** ‚Üí ECC-based encryption using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange and AES encryption.
- **Attack1.py** ‚Üí Simulated quantum attack on Lattice encryption using Qiskit.
- **Attack2.py** ‚Üí Simulated quantum attack on ECC encryption (Shor‚Äôs algorithm inspired).
- **CompareCrypto.py** ‚Üí Script to benchmark and compare both encryption schemes based on multiple security parameters.

## How It Works

### Crypto1 (Lattice-Based Encryption)
- Uses a public matrix **A**, a private secret vector **s**, and a small noise vector **e**.
- Encrypts a message by creating a ciphertext tuple (c1, c2).
- Decryption uses modular arithmetic to recover the original message.

### Crypto2 (ECC-Based Encryption)
- Generates ECC key pairs over the **P-256** curve.
- Derives a shared AES key using ECDH.
- Encrypts the message with AES-CBC using the derived key.

### Attack Simulations
- **Attack1.py**: Simulates a quantum attack on lattice encryption by creating superposition and random guesses.
- **Attack2.py**: Simulates a quantum circuit attack for ECC (e.g., Shor's algorithm behavior).

### Cryptographic Comparison
- **CompareCrypto.py** benchmarks both systems by:
  - Measuring encryption and decryption time.
  - Checking ciphertext size.
  - Calculating Shannon entropy.
  - Testing bit-flip resilience.
